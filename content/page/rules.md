1. We meet everyday, for 15 minutes, via Google Hangout.

2. The Hangout link is announced on Slack's `#general` channel

3. Goal of each session is to discuss what have we learned recently.

4. To keep it organized, there is only one topic discussed per session.

5. The topic is published on this page in advance.

6. After the meeting, meeting minutes are written to the session entry in this
   blog, so we can reference to it later.
